Hello there ğŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Gireesha, a data maestro on a mission to turn raw numbers into actionable insights and dashboards into works of art ğŸ‘€ using BI tools. 
When I'm not crunching numbers, you'll find me lost in the maze of SQL queries  ğŸ˜„ 

Lately I have been having fun learning ğŸŒ± Data science exploring Python and Machine Learning subjects .

My motto? Let's weave stories from data chaos, one visualization at a time! ğŸ“Šâœ¨
